/**
 * The ColumnExtractor class is a utility visitor for extracting column references from expressions.
 * It extends JSqlParser's ExpressionVisitorAdapter to traverse the expression tree and collect
 * all Column objects encountered.
 *
 * This utility is particularly useful for analyzing expressions to determine which columns are
 * referenced, which is essential for operations like:
 * - Projection push-down optimization
 * - Join condition analysis
 * - Identifying columns required for expression evaluation
 *
 * The class follows the visitor pattern, where the expression object accepts this visitor,
 * and the visit methods are called for each expression node in the tree.
